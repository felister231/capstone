<h3>The Bone Collector</h3>
<p>The Bone Collector is an example of everything bad about the serial-killer genre -- it's gruesome and needlessly complex, 
    only to end with a sudden avalanche of simplicity that teaches us nothing about the people involved. Content collapsed. 
    It's never boring and I always enjoy watching great performers do their thing.</p>
<h3>The One</h3>
    <p>In a stunning dual role, international star Jet Li portrays Gabriel Yulaw, a police officer confronted with a sinister 
    form of himself escaped from an advanced, parallel universe and intent on killing Gabriel. His alter ego's hunt culminates in a fateful battle 
    between good and evil that changes Gabriel's 
    perception of reality and forces him to examine the evil hidden within himself.</p>
<h3>Nowhere</h3>
        <p>Fleeing a totalitarian country, pregnant Mia must fight for her life when a violent storm knocks the container in which she has been hiding overboard. Trapped, Mia gives birth and is forced to survive to save her baby.</p>
