<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>As a recent graduate with Second-Class Honors in Supply Chain 
Management from Jomo Kenyatta University of 
Engineering and Technology, I bring a dedicated and hardworking 
attitude to any dynamic work environment. Throughout my academic 
journey, I've developed a solid foundation in supply chain principles
 and logistics, complemented by proficiency in teamwork, leadership, 
 and project management. My ability to analyze and adapt to dynamic 
 situations, coupled with excellent communication skills, positions 
 me as a valuable asset ready to contribute effectively to 
 organizational success.</p>
<p>My professional experiences, including roles as a Shift Supervisor
 at KFC Thika and a Customer Care Agent at Ecomatt Supermarket, have 
 further honed my skills. At KFC, I focused on enhancing team 
 productivity through efficient shift scheduling and fostering a 
 positive work environment to reduce turnover. Similarly, at 
 Ecomatt Supermarket, I prioritized customer satisfaction 
 by addressing issues promptly and streamlining communication 
 channels within the customer care team. These experiences 
 underscore my dedication to continuous improvement and client 
 satisfaction, making me an adaptable and valuable contributor
  to any organization.</p>
 <p>Beyond my work experiences, I possess a diverse skill set, 
 including proficiency in supply chain optimization, documentation, 
 and collaborative problem-solving. From my time as a Polling Clerk
 at IEBC, where I enhanced voter experience and ensured accuracy of
 voter records, to my role as a Transcriber at Verbit, contributing
 to making video and audio content universally accessible, I've
 consistently demonstrated a commitment to excellence. With 
 a passion for technology and backend development, I am eager
  to leverage my skills and contribute to innovative solutions in 
 the field of software engineering.</p>
